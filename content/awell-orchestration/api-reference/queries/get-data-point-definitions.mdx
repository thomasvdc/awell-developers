title: Get data point definitions
description: Retrieve the data dictionary for a pathway
---

For any given care flow/pathway a patient is included in, you might want to know what data points are captured in that pathway (i.e a data catalog). Inside the Awell Platform, you can simply navigate to the [data catalog](https://help.awellhealth.com/en/articles/4791428-data-catalog) of each care flow. 

You can also query all of your data point definitions via the API. With the `pathwayDataPointDefinitions` query, you're able to retrieve all data points definitions for a given pathway version.

## Release id

Every patient enrolled in a pathway is included in the last version of the pathway at the moment of pathway start. Because care flows/pathways can evolve over time, it might be that the oldest version of your pathway has a totally different data dictionary compared to the most recent version.

Therefore, to query all the data point definitions for a given pathway version, you need to specify the `release_id` as an input parameter for this query.

### Version vs. release id

The `version` of a pathway is an auto-incremented and human-readable numerical value (eg: version 5). However, every version also has a unique identifier which is called the `release_id`. The `version` and `release_id` are returned in all pathway related queries.

**Example:**
All patients included in version 5 of the pathway have the same `release_id`.

## Query

```graphql
query GetPathwayDataPointDefinitions(
  $release_id: String!
  $category: [String!]
  $value_type: [String!]
) {
  pathwayDataPointDefinitions(
    filters: { category: { in: $category }, value_type: { in: $value_type } }
    release_id: $release_id
  ) {
    data_point_definitions {
      id
      title
      key
      category
      valueType
      possibleValues {
        value
        label
      }
      range
      unit
      optional
    }
  }
}
```

## Variables

### Required parameters

A `release_id` needs to be specified in order to retrieve the data dictionary for a pathway.

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[2]]}>
  {`
{
  "release_id": "{{ RELEASE_ID }}",
  "category": [
    "CALCULATION",
    "FORM",
    "PATIENT_PROFILE",
    "PATHWAY",
    "TRACK",
    "STEP"
  ],
  "value_type": ["BOOLEAN", "DATE", "NUMBER", "NUMBERS_ARRAY", "STRING"]
}
  `}
</code>

### Filters

All filter values are optional, if you don't provide any filter all data points for the pathway will be returned.
Sending an empty filter will result in a search for the matching field to be empty.

All `in` filters accept a list of values and result in an `is any of` search criteria.

When specifying multiple filters, the resulting criteria is the conjuction of all filters.

<code className="language-json" highlightedRows={[[3, 11]]}>
  {`
{
  "release_id": "{{ RELEASE_ID }}",
  "category": [
    "CALCULATION",
    "FORM",
    "PATIENT_PROFILE",
    "PATHWAY",
    "TRACK",
    "STEP"
  ],
  "value_type": ["BOOLEAN", "DATE", "NUMBER", "NUMBERS_ARRAY", "STRING"]
}
  `}
</code>
